## The CentOS Project

The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused on delivering a robust open source ecosystem. For users, we offer a consistent manageable platform that suits a wide variety of deployments. For open source communities, we offer a solid, predictable base to build upon, along with extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain their code.

Weâ€™re also expanding the availability of CentOS images across a number of vendors, providing official images for [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW), Google, and more. For self-hosted cloud, we also provide a [generic cloud-init enabled image.](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2.xz)

For more information about updates and improvements in CentOS 7, please check out the [release notes](http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS7) or the [release announcement](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2015-March/021006.html) in the mailing list archive.
