We would like to announce the general availability of CentOS Atomic Host (May 2015), a lean operating system designed to run Docker containers, derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host (7.1.2), and built from standard CentOS 7 RPMs. 

CentOS Atomic Host is produced by the [CentOS Atomic SIG](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic), based on upstream work from  [Project Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/). 

READMORE

CentOS Atomic Host is available as a qcow2 image, as VirtualBox or libvirt-formatted Vagrant box and as an installable ISO image. These images are available for download at [cloud.centos.org](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/). The backing ostree repo is published to [mirror.centos.org](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/x86_64/repo).

If you currently run an atomic host (from any distro or release in the past), you can rebase to this released CentOS Atomic Host by running the following two commands :

```
  ostree remote add centos-atomic-host http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/x86_64/repo
  rpm-ostree rebase  centos-atomic-host:centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/standard
```

## Images

The [CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2) (847MB)  is suitable for use in on-premise and local virtualised environments. We test this on OpenStack, AWS and local Libvirt installs. In order to login, you will need to provide a cloud-init consumeable metadata source, like the NoCloud iso file. The Generic Cloud image is also available [compressed in gz format](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2.gz) (388 MB) and [xz compressed](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-GenericCloud.qcow2.xz) (308MB).

The [installer ISO](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Installer.iso) (660 MB) can be used via regular install methods (PXE, CD, USB image, etc.) and uses the Anaconda installer to deliver the CentOS Atomic Host. This allows flexibility to control the install using kickstarts and define custom storage, networking and user accounts. This is the recommended process for getting CentOS Atomic Host onto bare metal machines, or to generate your own image sets for custom environments.

[CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Libvirt.box](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Libvirt.box) (385 MB) and [CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Virtualbox.box](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/atomic/images/CentOS-Atomic-Host-7-Vagrant-Virtualbox.box) (395 MB) are Vagrant boxes for Libvirt and Virtualbox providers. 

The easiest way to consume these images is via the Atlas / Vagrant Cloud setup (see [https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/atomic-host](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/atomic-host). For example, getting the VirtualBox instance up would involve running the following two commands on a machine with vagrant installed:

```
  vagrant init centos/atomic-host && vagrant up --provider virtualbox 
```

* Kernel 3.10.0-229
* Docker 1.6.0
* Kubernetes 0.15.0-123
* Flannel 0.2.0

## Release Cycle

The rebuild image will follow the upstream Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host cadence. After sources are released, they'll be rebuild and included in new images. After the images are tested by the SIG and deemed ready, they'll be announced. If you'd like to help with the process, there's plenty to do!

## Getting Involved

The CentOS Atomic SIG seeks to produce two 'streams' for users, a rebuild of the RHEL Atomic Host, and a monthly release that tracks upstream components more closely. Users who want to take a more conservative approach to components like Docker, Kubernetes, and so forth will prefer the rebuild.

Our monthly image gives the community the opportunity to preview new technologies, and to experiment with packages that may not be carried in RHEL Atomic Host. If you'd like to work on testing images, help with packaging, documentation, or even help define the direction of our montly release -- join us! 

The SIG meets weekly on Thursdays at 16:00 UTC in the #centos-devel channel, and you'll often find us in #atomic and/or #centos-devel if you have questions. You can also join the [atomic-devel](https://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel) mailing list if you'd like to discuss the direction of Project Atomic, its components, or have other questions. 

## Getting Help

If you run into any problems with the images or components, feel free to ask on the [centos-devel](http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-devel) mailing list.
