Project Atomic is pleased to announce the release of the Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) 1.6, a Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use development environment for container applications. With the ADB, developers can dive right into producing complex, multi-container applications. The ADB is useful on Microsoft Windows, Apple's OS X and GNU/Linux distributions.

The 1.6 release adds several new features, including:

  * [Mesos Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) as a supported container orchestrator
  * A new delivery location in HashiCorp's Atlas box catalog, [projectatomic/adb](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/projectatomic/boxes/adb)
  * ADB descriptive details now reported in /etc/os-release:
    * `VARIANT="Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB)"`
    * `VARIANT_ID="adb"`
    * `VARIANT_VERSION="1.6.0"`
  * Updated Documentation, a new Maintainer and [more](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

The ADB provides a container development ecosystem that ensures that developers are able to work with Linux containers even if their base operating system does not support it.

The ADB provides a quick and easy way to setup multi-container applications that take advantage of management and/or orchestration solutions, such as [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.org/) or [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). The ADB also supports [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/). These projects provide a structure for packaging, distributing, and deploying multi-container applications.
