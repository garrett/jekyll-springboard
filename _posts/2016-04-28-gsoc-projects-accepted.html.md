The students have been selected for Google Summer of Code 2016.  [Through the Fedora Project](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-google-summer-of-code-2016/), Project Atomic has three students who will be working on projects this summer:

* Allan E. Gardner, in RPM-OSTree: [Drop privileges for HTTP fetches](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2016#Drop_privileges_for_HTTP_fetches)
* Amila Sampath, in Atomic Host, [Automatic Atomic Host Updates](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2016#Automatic_Atomic_Host_Updates)
* Harish Anand, in Cockpit, [Support For Systemd Timers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2016#Cockpit_support_for_systemd_timers)

We are very excited to be participating in GSOC with Fedora, and are looking forward to the amazing things these students will do.
