Summer is approaching, and it's time for camp! [Container.Camp](http://container.camp/), that is. 

Okay, that's a bit of a hokey lead-in. The good news is that I'll try to avoid that sort of thing during my talk at Container.Camp this Friday.

Container.Camp is happening at Broadway Studios near San Francisco's North Beach, walking distance from the Montgomery BART, MUNI, and cable car stations. Tickets are still available, and the featured speakers are excellent! The schedule includes several folks from Docker, one of the lead Kubernetes developers from Google, and other folks doing good work in the Linux container space. 

I'll be there to talk about Project Atomic and meet up with folks who are using containers in development and production. Hope to see you there!
