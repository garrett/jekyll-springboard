I recently answered an email asking about --selinux-enabled in the docker daemon, I thought others might wonder about this, so I wrote this blog.

``--selinux-enabled` on the docker daemon causes it to set SELinux labels on the containers.  Docker reads the contexts file `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/lxc_contexts` for the default context to run containers.

```
cat /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/lxc_contexts
process = "system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0"
content = "system_u:object_r:virt_var_lib_t:s0"
file = "system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0"
sandbox_kvm_process = "system_u:system_r:svirt_qemu_net_t:s0"
sandbox_kvm_process = "system_u:system_r:svirt_qemu_net_t:s0"
sandbox_lxc_process = "system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0"
```

Docker by default uses a confined SELinux type `svirt_lxc_net_t` to isolate the container processes from the host, and it generates a unique MCS label to allow SELinux to prevent one container process from attacking other container processes and content.

If you don't specify `--selinux-enabled`, docker does not execute SELinux code to set labels. When docker launches a container process, the system falls back to default transition policy.  This means the container processes will either run as docker_t or spc_t (depending on the version of policy you have installed). Both of these types are unconfined.  SELinux will provide no security separation for these container processes.

> In addition, I'm also wondering what the impact will be, when `--selinux-enabed` is set to TRUE together with `--icc` to TRUE? Does it have any impact or is it unrelated.

It's unrelated. `--icc FALSE` sets up iptables rules that prevent containers from connecting to each other over the local network to each other.  The default SELinux policy allows all network connectivity between containers.

> Also, does anybody know what will happen if I run `docker` with `--selinux-enabled` for a while (so start containers, pull images, etc.) and then restart the daemon with `--selinux-enabled`. Is it possible that it does impact the environment somehow and that certain activities need to be done or shouldn't this affect the service at all?

The only potential problem I can think of would be volume mounting being mislabeled.  If you volume mount content off of the host with `-v /source/path:/dest/path:Z` and SELinux is disabled, docker will not set up labels for the container.  If you later turn on `--selinux-enabled` these containers would not be able to read/write the content in the mounted volume.  Thinking about this further, I am not sure what labels the containers created while `--selinux-disabled` was set.  These pre-created containers would probably continue to run with an unconfined domain, and newer containers would run with confinement.
