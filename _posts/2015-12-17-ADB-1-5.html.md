Project Atomic is pleased to announce the release of the Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) 1.5, a Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use development environment for container applications. With ADB, developers can dive right into producing complex, multi-container applications.

The 1.5 release adds the ability to develop and test using [OpenShift Origin v3](http://www.openshift.org/). The ADB is useful on Microsoft Windows, Apple's OS X and GNU/Linux distributions. The ADB provides a container development ecosystem that ensures that developers are able to work with Linux containers even if their base operating system does not support it.

The ADB provides a quick and easy way to setup multi-container applications that take advantage of management and/or orchestration solutions, such as OpenShift or [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). The ADB also supports [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/). These projects provide a structure for packaging, distributing, and deploying multi-container applications.

Notable features of ADB v1.5 include:

 * Docker, Kubernetes and other ecosystem packages are shipped and configured in the Vagrant box.
 * The Vagrant box has [device mapper thin provisioning storage setup](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/06/notes-on-fedora-centos-and-docker-storage-drivers/) for docker images, similarly to production instances of RHEL/CentOS/Fedora Atomic Hosts.
 * Setup OpenShift just with the the `vagrant up` command and a shipped [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/components/centos/centos-with-openshift).
 * Setup single node kubernetes with the `vagrant up` command and a shipped [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/tree/master/components/centos/centos-k8s-singlenode-setup).
 * Users can directly run Docker commands on hosts, such as Windows and OS X, that do not directly support Docker.  [Read More](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst#using-the-box-from-the-host)
 * The ADB is able to integrate with [Eclipse docker tooling](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Docker_Tooling). [Read More](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/components/centos/centos-docker-eclipse/README.rst)
