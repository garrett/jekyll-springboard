A fast release since 0.3.1, we've now released [0.4.0](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases) of [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/)!

Our biggest change is the renaming of `atomicapp install` to `atomicapp fetch`.

In order to fetch the container from the `atomic` cli, you are required to use the `run` command and pass the `--mode=fetch` parameters.

```sh
  atomic run projectatomic/myapp --mode=fetch --destination ./
```

Within `atomicapp` you may simply use fetch.

```sh
  atomicapp fetch projectatomic/myapp --destination ./
```

The main features of this release are:

  * Renaming install to fetch
  * Enabling users to pass an answers file as a URL `atomicapp run projectatomic/atomicapp -a https://foobar.com/answers.conf`
