I am pleased to announce the initial release of [Atomic Registry](http://www.projectatomic.io/registry/).
This is an open source, collaborative effort between [OpenShift Origin](https://www.openshift.org/) and the [Cockpit Project](http://cockpit-project.org/). With these projects we build on a
foundation that has a deep understanding of container technology and a disciplined
approach to software development.

### Highlights

Here are a few features we've pulled into Atomic Registry that we believe any enterprise registry should have:

* Clean, user-focused web interface
* Single sign-on (SSO) user experience with enterprise and cloud identity providers
* Role-based access control (RBAC) to distribute images securely
* Flexible storage options
* Designed for clustering and high availability

Check out this video introducing the user interface console.

### Try it out

Atomic Registry is available now. We put together a [quickstart install](http://docs.projectatomic.io/registry/latest/registry_quickstart/administrators/index.html)
to get it up and running quickly on a system. [Documentation](http://docs.projectatomic.io/registry/) covers the architecture,
installation and management of the registry.

### Contribute

This is a 100% open source project. Please give us your feedback, ideas and contributions and help us make it better.
