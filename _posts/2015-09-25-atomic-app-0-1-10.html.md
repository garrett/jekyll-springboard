My team is please to announce the immediate availability of [Atomic App 0.1.10](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases/tag/0.1.10). We have release this as an intermediate step to unlock some blocked issues within Atomic App. For a (nearly) full list of changes have a look at [the changelog](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Please be reminded, that any contributions are highly appreciated, but please make sure you have some tests (on new features) and documentation, and a look at our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks for all the help with Atomic App!!
