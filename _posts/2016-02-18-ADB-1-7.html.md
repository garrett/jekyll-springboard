Project Atomic is pleased to announce the release of the Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) 1.7.0, a Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use development environment for container applications. With the ADB, developers can dive right into producing complex, multi-container applications. The ADB is useful on Microsoft Windows, Appleâ€™s OS X, and Linux distributions.

The 1.7.0 release adds several new features, including:

 * OpenShift is now managed as a systemd unit file with full functionality (start/stop/restart), making it a single step to set up OpenShift on one machine. This will help application developers who want to develop and test applications on OpenShift on their laptop or workstation.
 * The new SCCLI command-line tool to can help users move between Kubernetes and OpenShift setup.
 * A new vagrant plugin, vagrant-service-manager, that manages the services inside of the ADB. This plugin is recommended for use with the ADB and fully replaces vagrant-adbinfo.

 This release also includes many smaller changes and bugfixes, which are detailed in the [release comments](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

The ADB provides a container development ecosystem that ensures that developers are able to work with Linux containers even if their base operating system does not support it. It also offers a quick and easy way to setup multi-container applications to take advantage of management and/or orchestration solutions, such as OpenShift or Kubernetes. The ADB supports [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/). These projects provide a structure for packaging, distributing, and deploying multi-container applications.

The ADB is built as part of Project Atomic, which integrates the tools and patterns of container-based application and service deployment with trusted operating system platforms to deliver an end-to-end hosting architecture that's modern, reliable, and secure.
