The past weeks have been packed with preparations for Red Hat Summit 2015 and getting [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/) and the [Nulecule Specification](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/) into good shape. Now that we have finished that, we put at new release process in place and found a new home for the normative Nulecule Specification documents.

Additionally, the first extension of the Nulecule Specification has been started!

READMORE

Starting with Nulecule Specification 0.0.2 we will host the human readable normative document at [projectatomic.io](www.projectatomic.io/nulecule/0.0.2/), and a machine readable version (aka the JSON schema) will live on [GitHub](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/blob/v0.0.2/spec/0.0.2/schema.json).

GitHub will be the place where we will continue working on the specification, the [master branch](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/) will always carry the most up to date working draft. And we encorage you to participate in the development by submitting feature requests or pull requests.

One of our collaborators has started extending the Nulecule Specification by adding '[Nulecule Image Specification](https://github.com/bkabrda/nulecule-images)'. We see this as an extension to the core features of Nulecule, and we have designed the Nulecule Specification with exactly this approach in our minds: Nulecule Specification is small and simple (configure and deploy applications) and Extension Specifications enrich the feature set (how to build the application and all its dependencies).

[Slavek Kabrda](https://github.com/bkabrda) is one of the main contributors to DevAssistant and has drafted a first version of the '[Nulecule Image Specification](https://github.com/bkabrda/nulecule-images)', please take a critical look at it and join the development by  commenting and experimenting with it!

PS: at least at [devconf.cz](http://devconf.cz/) last year Slavek was pretty open to offer beer-rewards for contributions...
