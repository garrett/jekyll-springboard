The original mission of the [atomic application](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic) to install, manage, and run container images using container labels has slowly been growing.  We have been concentrating on ease-of-use and value-add functions for containers and images, and to accomplish this have recently added the `atomic diff` command.  This command allows you to differentiate between two container images, which is critically important if you are like me and you have hundreds of container images on your system. I also use it when I pull an updated image from a repository and want to see what has changed.

> **Note:** While docker itself has a subcommand called `diff`, it is only useful when trying to determine the difference between a container and its image.  It does not compare two different docker objects looking for differences amongst them.

The `atomic diff` command is fairly simple to run.  By default it will provide a file-level diff between the two docker-based objects grouped by:

* Files only found in docker object A
* Files only found in docker object B
* Files found in both docker objects but differ

It can optionally also evaluate the differences between those same objects if they are RPM-based.  Looking at a real-world example will probably illuminate its usefulness more readily.

For this example, I have created two simple images that use the CentOS base image as a seed image. In one image, I have added the package wget and in the other I have added the package less.  The two Dockerfiles are, respectively:

```
FROM docker.io/centos:latest
RUN yum -y install less && yum clean all
```

```
FROM docker.io/centos:latest
RUN yum -y install wget && yum clean all
```

And my docker images look like:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE
centos_with_less    latest              29ef3785d2d7        About a minute ago   217.2 MB
centos_with_wget    latest              3b32e38b6eb0        18 minutes ago       214.3 MB
docker.io/centos    latest              c8a648134623        2 weeks ago          196.6 MB
```
To perform an atomic diff of these two images, we simply issue the `atomic diff` command followed by the two image IDs or names.  Because we are not passing any additional switches to the atomic command, the output will look like:

```
$ sudo atomic diff centos_with_less centos_with_wget
Files only in centos_with_less:
     /bin/gtroff
     /bin/troff
     /bin/lessecho
     /bin/lesspipe.sh
     /bin/lesskey
     /bin/gtbl
     /bin/zsoelim
     /bin/gnroff
     # content omitted for space

Files only in centos_with_wget:
     /bin/wget
     /run/secrets
     /etc/wgetrc
     /usr/bin/wget
     /usr/share/locale/en_GB/LC_MESSAGES/wget.mo
     # content omitted for space

Common files that are different:
     /var/lib/yum/history/history-2015-12-23.sqlite
     /var/lib/yum/history/history-2015-12-23.sqlite-journal
     /var/lib/rpm/Packages
     /var/lib/rpm/Group
     /var/lib/rpm/Name
     /var/lib/rpm/Sha1header
     # content omitted for space
```

In these results, we can observe all three potential groups or categories.  In the output of `Files only in centos_with_less`, we can see evidence of the less RPM by the groff-related RPM dependency.  In the `Files only in centos_with_wget` output, we see the wget binary itself.  And in the `Common files that are different` category, we can see that both docker objects have a file called `/var/lib/Packages` but they differ, which makes good sense since that file is altered by yum/rpm when a package is added or removed.

I also mentioned earlier that atomic diff can differentiate between two RPM-based docker objects.  This can be done by adding the `-r` or `--rpms` switch to the `atomic diff` command.  In the next example, I will perform an atomic diff passing `-r` to evaluate the RPMs and `-n`, which tells atomic diff to not evaluate the files (as we did above).

```
$ sudo atomic diff -r -n centos_with_less centos_with_wget

centos_with_less                  | centos_with_wget
--------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (   | CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (  
Core)                             | Core)
--------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
groff-base-0-1.22.2               |
less-0-458                        |
                                  | wget-0-1.14
```

By default, we only show the RPMs that differ.  If you pass the `-v` (verbose) flag, it will show all the common RPMs as well.

One useful switch is the `--json` switch, which outputs the results in json format.  This can be handy if you have a tool that perhaps analyzes the results, because you can pipe the output into your own tooling.  An example of the JSON-based output is as follows:

```
{
    "centos_with_less": {
        "release": "CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core) \n",
        "all_rpms": [
            "acl-0-2.2.51",
            "audit-libs-0-2.4.1",
            "basesystem-0-10.0",
            # content omitted for space
        ],
        "exclusive_rpms": [
            "groff-base-0-1.22.2",
            "less-0-458"
        ],
        "common_rpms": [
            "acl-0-2.2.51",
            "audit-libs-0-2.4.1",
            "basesystem-0-10.0",
            # content omitted for space
        ]
    },
    "centos_with_wget": {
        "release": "CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core) \n",
        "all_rpms": [
            "acl-0-2.2.51",
            "audit-libs-0-2.4.1",
            "basesystem-0-10.0",
            # content omitted for space
        ],
        "exclusive_rpms": [
            "wget-0-1.14"
        ],
        "common_rpms": [
            "acl-0-2.2.51",
            "audit-libs-0-2.4.1",
            "basesystem-0-10.0",
            # content omitted for space
        ]
    }
}
```

The next time you need to perform some analysis between two docker objects, remember that `atomic diff` exists and can do some of the heavy lifting for you.  It works on comparing images to images, images to containers, and containers to containers.
