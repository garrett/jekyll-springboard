I have contributed support for a `no-new-privileges` option to [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/20727).
This flag has already been included in [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/557) and the Open Container Initiative [spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs/pull/290).

The new flag supports, in Docker, a security feature that was added to the Linux kernel back in 2012 under the name `no_new_privs`.

READMORE

The kernel feature works as follows:

* A process can set the `no_new_privs` bit in the kernel that persists across fork, clone, and exec.
* The `no_new_privs` bit ensures that the process or its children processes do not gain any additional privileges.
* A process isn't allowed to unset the `no_new_privs` bit once it is set.
* Processes with `no_new_privs` are not allowed to change uid/gid or gain any other capabilities, even if the process executes setuid binaries or executables with file capability bits set.
* `no_new_privs` also prevents Linux Security Modules (LSMs) like SELinux from transitioning to process labels that have access not allowed to the current process. This means an SELinux process is only allowed to transition to a process type with less privileges.

For more details see the [kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt).

Here is an example showcasing how it helps in Docker.

Create a setuid binary that displays the effective uid:

```
[$ dockerfiles]# cat testnnp.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        printf("Effective uid: %d\n", geteuid());
        return 0;
}
[$ dockerfiles]# make testnnp
cc     testnnp.c   -o testnnp
```

Now we will add the binary to a docker image:

```
[$ dockerfiles]# cat Dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest
ADD testnnp /root/testnnp
RUN chmod +s /root/testnnp
ENTRYPOINT /root/testnnp

[$ dockerfiles]# docker build -t testnnp .

 ---> 44f767c67e30

Successfully built 44f767c67e30
```

Now we will create and run a container without `no-new-privileges`:

```
[$ dockerfiles]# docker run -it --rm --user=1000  testnnp
Effective uid: 0
```
This shows that even though you requested a non-privileged user (UID=1000) to run your container, that user would be able to become root by executing the setuid app on the container image.

Running with `no-new-privileges` prevents the uid transition while running a setuid binary:

```
[$ dockerfiles]# docker run -it --rm --user=1000 --security-opt=no-new-privileges testnnp
Effective uid: 1000
```

As you can see above the container process is still running as UID=1000, meaning that even if the image has dangerous code in it, we can still prevent the user from escalating privileges.

Turning on `no_new_privs` actually stopped the SELinux transition from the docker daemon type `docker_t` to the container type, `svirt_lxc_net_t`. The `no_new_privs` option only allows SELinux transitions from one type to another if the target type as a complete subset of the source type. Dan Walsh worked on the SELinux policy for docker to fix this. With the latest policy in Fedora 24, `no_new_privs` and SELinux work well together. We will be back-porting these fixes to RHEL when we ship docker support for `no_new_privs`.

If you want to allow users to run images as a non-privileged UID, in most cases you would want to prevent them from becoming root. `no_new_privileges` is a great tool for guaranteeing this.
