What the heck is commissaire? I'm glad you asked! Commissaire is a new
component of Project Atomic that aims to simplify life for cluster
administrators.  It provides a simple, script-friendly REST interface
for cluster-wide maintenance operations like system upgrades and
rolling restarts.

Instead of starting from scratch, Commissaire utilizes common
technologies such as Ansible for communicating with cluster nodes, and
interfaces with OpenShift and Kubernetes.
