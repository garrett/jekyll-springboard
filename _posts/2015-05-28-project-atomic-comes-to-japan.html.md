In case you missed the news on Twitter, we're taking this show on the road! Specifically, we have a few opportunities to learn more about Project Atomic in Tokyo, Japan. 

Next week, I'll be attending [LinuxCon Japan](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-japan) to [speak about Project Atomic](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-japan/program/schedule) and the traditional package problems. 

We'll also be hosting a [Meetup in Ebisu](https://redhat.smartseminar.jp/public/seminar/view/231) on 2 June at the Red Hat Tokyo office! If you're local to Tokyo (or can get there easily) then you should definitely sign up and check out the Meetup!

Have a meetup, talk, or event where you're discussing Project Atomic and want to spread the word? Shoot me an email to jzb at Red Hat or find me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/jzb).
