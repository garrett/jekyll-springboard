Still wondering what this Atomic stuff is all about? Want a quick primer on Project Atomic?

Join us on Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern for a high level introduction to Project Atomic and its components. We'll look at all the "pieces" of Atomic, from Atomic Host, to rpm-ostree, the Atomic command (/usr/bin/atomic), Nulecule, and Atomic App. 

The event is hosted on BlueJeans, you can view the event using your Browser (a plugin is required for Firefox) or using the BlueJeans app on iOS or Android.
