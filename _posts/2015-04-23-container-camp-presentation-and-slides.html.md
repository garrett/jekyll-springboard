Last week I had the opportunity to attend Container.Camp in San Francisco and present an introduction to Project Atomic. If you didn't get to attend – or just want to relive the talk – you can [find it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPltG4YdKVE) (also embedded below). 

If you'd like to see all of the Container.Camp presentations, they're available on YouTube [under the Container.Camp channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvksXSnLqIVM_uFB7xyrsSg). Thanks again to the Container.Camp organizers for inviting me to speak, it was a great event. Fantastic speakers, really interesting venue, and a great crowd.
