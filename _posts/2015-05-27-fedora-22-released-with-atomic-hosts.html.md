A quick note for folks who might have missed the announcement yesterday, [Fedora 22 was officially released](http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-22-released/), along with [Atomic images](https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/atomic.html) for OpenStack/KVM, Amazon EC2, and Vagrant.

The Vagrant images are suitable for VirtualBox and libvirt/KVM, so they're usable on Linux (libvirt), or Mac OS X and Windows (VirtualBox) with the appropriate Vagrant providers. Josef Stříbný has written up a short tutorial on [using Vagrant images on Fedora 22](http://fedoramagazine.org/running-vagrant-fedora-22/) on Fedora Magazine.

Of course, Fedora 22 also includes the Workstation and Server editions – and the Fedora 22 Docker image will be available via the Docker Hub very soon.
