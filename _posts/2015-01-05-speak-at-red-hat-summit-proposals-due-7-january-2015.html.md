With just a few days into 2015, it may not seem like it &ndash; but [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/) and DevNation are *just* around the corner. The call for proposals [is due to close on 7 January](https://rhs2015.smarteventscloud.com/portal/cfp/cfpLogin.ww), and we'd like to encourage folks who are doing interesting things with Atomic and containers to submit proposals before the CfP closes. 

We really want to hear from you, so if you're working with Atomic and have something interesting to say &ndash; get those proposals in today! Whether you're working with CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL Atomic Host, we'd like to hear from you.

If you're submitting a proposal around Project Atomic, please drop me a line at jzb at RedHat.com &ndash; and feel free to ping me if you would like some help with the proposal or want to bounce a few ideas around. See you at Red Hat Summit in Boston!
