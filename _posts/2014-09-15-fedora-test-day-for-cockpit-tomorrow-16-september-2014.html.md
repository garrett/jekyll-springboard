The Fedora Project holds regular Test Days to help put releases or individual components through their paces. This week, Fedora's Test Day will focus on [Cockpit](http://cockpit-project.org/), which will be part of the Fedora Atomic Host in Fedora 21.

If you'd like to participate, be sure to [look over the Test Day on the Fedora wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2014-09-16_Cockpit) and check out the prerequisites, test cases, and how to file results and bugs.

Note that the test day runs all day, and you should be able to find help in the [#fedora-test-day](irc://irc.freenode.net/#fedora-test-day) channel on Freenode. (New to IRC? See [the Fedora guide on IRC](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC).) 

Questions? Ask on the [cockpit-devel](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/cockpit-devel) mailing list.
