## CentOS Linux

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). We are now looking to expand on that by creating the resources needed by other communities to come together and be able to build on the CentOS Linux platform. And today we start the process by delivering a clear governance model, increased transparency and access. In the coming weeks we aim to publish our own roadmap that includes variants of the core CentOS Linux.

Since March 2004, CentOS Linux has been a community-supported distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by Red Hat. As such, CentOS Linux aims to be functionally compatible with RHEL. We mainly change packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork. CentOS Linux is no-cost and [free to redistribute](/legal).

CentOS Linux is developed by a small but growing team of core developers. In turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, managers, core Linux contributors, and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.

Over the coming year, the CentOS Project will expand its mission to establish CentOS Linux as a leading community platform for emerging open source technologies coming from other projects such as OpenStack. These technologies will be at the center of multiple variations of CentOS, as individual downloads or accessed from a custom installer. Read more about the [variants](/variants) and [Special Interest Groups](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup) that produce them.

## The CentOS Project

The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused around the goal of providing a rich base platform for open source communities to build upon. We will provide a development framework for cloud providers, the hosting community, and scientific data processing, as a few examples. We work with several ‘upstream’ communities to help them layer and distribute their software more effectively on a platform they can rely on.

### The Governing Board

The CentOS Governing Board is made up of members of the CentOS Project, many of whom have been around since the creation of the Project, as well as new members from Red Hat who were instrumental in bringing the new relationship together. The focus of the Governing Board is to curate the CentOS Project, assist and guide in the progress and development of the various SIGs, as well as to promote CentOS Linux. For more information read the [governance page](/about/governance).

### The Project Structure

The CentOS Project is modelled on the structure of the [Apache Foundation](http://apache.org), with a governing board that oversees various semi-autonomous [Special Interest Groups or ‘SIGs’](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup). These groups are focused on providing various enhancements, addons, or replacements for core CentOS Linux functionality. A few notable examples of SIGs are:

- [Core](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Core) - Building and releasing the core CentOS Linux platform.
- [Xen4CentOS](http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/Xen4-01) - Providing Xen4 support for CentOS 6
- [CentOS Design](http://wiki.centos.org/ArtWork) - Improving the user experience with high quality artwork
